Installation
==================

   :local:

Requirements
************
 - Python (2.7+ recommended)
 - IBM CPLEX Optimization Studio (12.9+ recommended)
 - Numpy (1.12+ recommended)

For more details on installing Cplex and what version to use see this section on :ref:`Installing Cplex<cplex-install>`.

Older Python or Cplex versions may work but have not been tested.

Installing Compass
*******************
If Numpy is not installed, you can install it with

.. code:: bash

   python -m pip install numpy
   
This needs to be installed before the other requirements because a C extension needs the location of numpy headers to compile.

.. note::
   Accessing pip through python -m pip is done to emphasize that on systems with multiple python installations (e.g. python 2.7 and python 3.6) Compass and Cplex must be installed to the same version of python. It is otherwise identical to just using pip. Using sudo can also invoke a different version of python depending on your environment.

Then simplest way to install Compass is using pip to install from the github repository. This can be done with the following command in the terminal:

.. code:: bash

   python -m pip install git+https://github.com/yoseflab/Compass.git --upgrade

This command will also update Compass to the newest version. Alternatively, you can clone the Compass repository and run setup.py.

Now to test if everything is installed, simply run:

.. code:: bash

   compass -h

You should see the help text print out if installation was succesful :) For more details on how to use Compass you can visit our :doc:`tutorial <tutorial>`.

Installing Cplex
****************

Compass relies on CPLEX, an optimization engine developed by IBM and free for academic use.
In particular Compass uses its Python API (distinct from Docplex). 

CPLEX needs to be installed directly from IBM. We note that it may be simpler to download the
installation files locally and SCP/File Transfer them over to the
corresponding server.

Cplex Versions
--------------
The version of Cplex to install will depend on what version of Python you want to use Cplex with, as IBM has gradually phased out support for older Python versions 
with `Cplex 12.10 dropping support for Python 2.x. <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P_12.10.0/ilog.odms.studio.help/CPLEX/ReleaseNotes/topics/releasenotes12100/convert.html>`__ 
As a non-exhaustive list of tested Cplex versions (followed by their part number):

 - Python 3.7 or 3.8: Cplex 20.10 (CJ8GXML)
 - Python 3.6: Cplex 12.10 (CJ6BPML)
 - Python 2.7: Cplex 12.9 (CJ4Z5ML)

To more directly find these versions of Cplex, you can use `IBM's software search page <https://www-03.ibm.com/isc/esd/dswdown/home.wss>`__ and enter the part numbers into the "Find by part number" search box.

Download
--------

First navigate to the main page for CPLEX `here <https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio>`__ 

Compass requires the full edition of CPLEX, which is free for academic use. Click the ‘Get student and faculty editions’ link.

Register an account or Log In to an existing account. Once logged in, \
scroll down to the ‘Software’ section and to a download page for “ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio”.

Here there are a bunch of options. Find the one corresponding to your 
operating system, for example “IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio 12.9
for Linux x86-64 Multilingual (CNZM2ML)” and check it. Then click
‘Download Now’ at the bottom of the page. Then you probably will need to
click the ‘install / re-install Download Director’ popup on the bottom
and follow the instructions there.

Finally, you will be able to download
``cplex_studio129.linux-x86-64.bin`` (or the corresponding file for your version and OS) .

Linux Install Walkthrough
-------------------------

Once the file has been transferred, on the Ubuntu instance, execute the
installer by running the following commands:

First install Java (required by CPLEX) if you haven’t already done so.

.. note::
   You may not require sudo for the following two commands depending on your environment. Given the packages install without errors, Compass should function fine.

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt-get install default-jre

Then:

.. code:: bash

   cd ~
   chmod +x cplex_studio129.linux-x86-64.bin
   sudo ./cplex_studio129.linux-x86-64.bin

Follow the instructions in the installer, accepting the license
agreement and choosing to install to the default path
``/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio129``.

Afterwards, if it has installed successfully, you can remove the installer file
with 
.. code:: bash

   rm ~/cplex_studio129.linux-x86-64.bin

Lastly, we need to install the Python module that comes with cplex. To
do this, run these commands:

.. code:: bash

   cd /opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio129/cplex/python/3.6/x86-64_linux
   python setup.py install

.. note::
   Note that this must install to the same version of python as Compass has/will be installed to. Otherwise Compass will be unable to import the Cplex python API.


If all is good, cplex will be installed! To test this simply open a
python instance and run the following command

.. code:: bash

   import cplex

If there are no errors, you’re good to go!

Installing on other Operating Systems
-------------------------------------

For installation on Windows or Mac the process will be similar. Navigate to [Cplex Install Directory]/cplex/python/[Python Version]/[OS] and run

.. code:: bash

   python3 setup.py install

For more detailed instructions see `IBM's Knowledge Center <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P_20.1.0/ilog.odms.studio.help/Optimization_Studio/topics/COS_installing.html>`__ and 
using the "Change version or product" to navigate to the version of Cplex you downloaded. 
Then see `here <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P_20.1.0/ilog.odms.cplex.help/CPLEX/GettingStarted/topics/set_up/Python_setup.html>`__ for how to setup the Python API of Cplex.
As before, if you can open a Python instance and run

.. code:: bash

   import cplex

Then you are good to go!
