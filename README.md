# Compass
### In-Silico Modeling of Metabolic Heterogeneity using Single-Cell Transcriptomes
Metabolism is a major regulator of immune cell function, but it remains difficult to study the metabolic status of individual cells. This motivated the development of Compass, an algorithm to characterize cellular metabolic states based on single-cell RNA-Seq and flux balance analysis (FBA).

For instructions on how to install and use Compass, visit the [documentation](https://yoseflab.github.io/Compass/). For a detailed description of the algorithm, refer to Wagner et al., <i>Cell</i> 2021 ([link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.05.045)).
