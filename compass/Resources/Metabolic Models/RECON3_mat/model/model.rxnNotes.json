However, E.C. 1.13.11.11 is for the reaction L-tryptophan + O2 = N-formyl-L-kynurenine. For the reaction 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan (Cytosol) + O2 (Cytosol) <=> 5-Hydroxy-N-formylkynurenine, E.C. should be 1.13.11.52. Conclusion: Change E.C. to 1.13.11.52 (source: KEGG).",

  "L-3-Phenyllactic acid (or PLA) is a chiral aromatic compound involved in phenylalanine metabolism. It is likely produced from phenylpyruvate via the action of lactate dehydrogenase. The D-form of this organic acid is typically derived from bacterial sources while the L-form is almost certainly endogenous. Levels of phenyllactate are normally very low in blood or urine. High levels of PLA in the urine or blood are often indicative of phenylketonuria (PKU) and hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA).",

  "Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.13) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:. acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine. Phenylacetylglycine or PAG is a glycine conjugate of phenylacetic acid. Phenylacetic acid may arise from exposure to styrene (plastic) or through the consumption of fruits and vegetables. Phenylacetic acid is used in some perfumes, possessing a honey-like odour in low concentrations, and is also used in penicillin G production. PAG is a putative biomarker of phospholipidosis. Urinary PAG is elevated in animals exhibiting abnormal phospholipid accumulation in many tissues and may thus be useful as a surrogate biomarker for phospholipidosis. (PMID: 15764292 ) The presence of phenylacetylglycine in urine has been confirmed for dogs, rats and mice. However, the presence of this compound in human urine is controversial. GC-MS studies have not found this compound (PMID: 7492634 ) while NMR studies claimed to have identified it (PMID: 21167146 ). It appears that phenylacetylglycine may sometimes be mistaken for phenylacetylglutamine via NMR. (HMDB00821). One proton added to product side for element and charge balance.",

Appreciable amounts of LPC are either formed in plasma by endothelial lipase [10] or by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) secreted from the liver to catalyse the transfer of fatty acids, preferentially linoleate which is in sn-2 position of phosphatidylcholine, to free cholesterol in plasma for the formation of cholesteryl esters [11]. Lysophospholipase substrates the reaction of LPC and water to carboxylate and glycerophosphocholine which is further converted to sn-glycerol-3-phosphate and choline by glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, located in both endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial, catalyses the formation of the lysoproduct LPA by the acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate. LPA may also be synthesized by PLA2 catalysed deacylation of phosphatidic acid (PA). PA is generated by the hydrolysis of PC by PC-specific phospholipase D (PLD) or the acylation of LPA by LPA acyl transferases. PA is an important metabolite involved in phospholipid biosynthesis and membrane remodeling. GPR association taken from Recon.",

In normal humans TA pathway exists but is of minor quantitative importance. In the present study we show that a rat skeletal-muscle preparation convert methionine carbon into TCA cycle intermediates, lactate, glutamate, alanine and CO2. The use of pyruvate as the co-substrate increased the recovery of both labels in CO2 and stimulated transamination. alpha-keto-glutarate is a poor substrate. Perry et al showed an IEM case that involved a defect in the oxidation of 4-methyl-thio-oxo-butyrate, and that transamination is an important route of methionine degradation in the human.",
  "The metabolism of 3-methylthiopropionate appears to be almost exclusively an hepatic process, on the basis of studies with homogenates of rat tissues. Transamination pathway of methionine may contribute significantly to methionine catabolism, especially when the capabilities of trans-sulfuration have been or impaired. 48% of the methionine transamination occurs in skeletal muscle and 40% in liver.

  "the evidence indicates that only vline, isoleucine, aspartate, and methionine are catabolized by skeletal muscle to provide carbon precursors for glutamate/glutamine and alanine. Knowledge of methionine metabolism in muscle is rather scanty. However, there is rather strong evidence that methionine is metabolied at least in part by a pathway independent of S-adenosylmethionine. This pathway involves first a transamination catalysed by the branched-chain amino acid amino transferases followed by oxidative decarboxylation by the branched-chain alpha-oxo-acid dehydrogenase. the reaminder of this pathway has not been fully described.",

The understanding of the biotransformation of flavonoids in the small intestine and the liver and that of their absorbed colonic metabolites is crucial for their bioactivity. The most common routes of metabolism are likely to be oxidation, reduction or hydrolysis, followed by conjugation reactions, or several competing pathways. Conjugation of hydroxyl groups with glucuronic acid or sulphate, or O-methylation might occur. Conjugation reactions with glucuronic acid or sulphate are reported to be the most common final step in the metabolic pathway of intact flavonoids.",

  "Here, we compare and contrast canonical membrane transport with a novel type of Ca(2+)-H+ coupling within cytoplasm, which produces uphill Ca2+ transport energized by spatial H+ ion gradients, and can result in the cytoplasmic compartmentalization of Ca2+ without requiring a partitioning membrane. The mechanism, demonstrated in mammalian myocytes, relies on diffusible cytoplasmic buffers, such as carnosine, homocarnosine and ATP, to which Ca2+ and H+ ions bind in an apparently competitive manner. These buffer molecules can actively recruit Ca2+ to acidic microdomains, in exchange for the movement of H+ ions. The resulting Ca2+ microdomains thus have the potential to regulate function locally. Spatial cytoplasmic Ca(2+)-H+ exchange (cCHX) acts like a pump without a membrane and may be operational in many cell types.",

We have not yet determined if other ions are required for the enhanced mevalonate uptake. Definitive proof for the expression of a transporter (in contrast to increased cellular metabolism or decreased mevalonate efflux) and its detailed characterization will require uncoupling transport and metabolic processes by partial purification and establishing an in vitro assay. Alternatively, the enhanced uptake of mevalonate could be a consequence of the fortuitous transport of mevalonate by a transporter of unknown function",

NA+-activation kinetics revealed that the NA+ to-N-acetyl-L-aspartate stoichiometry was 3 : 1 and concentration of Na+ necessary for half-maximal transport (KNA m) was 70 mm. NA+-dependent N-acetyl-L-aspartate transport was competitively inhibited by succinate with an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 14.7 microm, which was comparable to the Km value of NA+-dependent succinate transport (29.4 microm). aken collectively, these results indicate that NaC3 expressed in rat cerebrocortical astrocytes is responsible for NA+-dependent N-acetyl-L-aspartate transport.

  "The findings demonstrate that most of the flavonoids studied become glucuronidated on absorption through the jejunum (and ileum), and this occurs after first being deglycosylated in the case of administered natural flavonoid glycosides [49]. The understanding of the biotransformation of flavonoids in the small intestine and the liver and that of their absorbed colonic metabolites is crucial for their bioactivity. The most common routes of metabolism are likely to be oxidation, reduction or hydrolysis, followed by conjugation reactions, or several competing pathways. Conjugation of hydroxyl groups with glucuronic acid or sulphate, or O-methylation might occur. Conjugation reactions with glucuronic acid or sulphate are reported to be the most common final step in the metabolic pathway of intact flavonoids. One proton added to product side for mass and charge balancing. Reaction is elementally unbalanced for oxygen.",

  "Although cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, and deoxycholic acid are the predominent bile acids in human bile (1), small amounts of other bile acids including ursodeoxycholic acid are frequently detected (2). This bile acid is the 7-beta-epimer of chenodeoxycholic acid (Fig. 1) and under normal conditions represents less than 1% of the total biliary bile acids. This report describes the changes in biliary bile acid composition in seven individuals treated with chenodeoxycholic acid for 4 months. Increased amounts of a new bile acid were detected. This bile acid was identified as ursodeoxycholic acid, and was derived from chenodeoxycholic acid probably via a keto-bile acid intermediate. The demonstration of 3H radioactivity in the ursodeoxycholic acid fractions of these subjects plus the appearance of the specific activity-time curves suggest that ursodeoxycholic acid was derived from cheinodeoxycholic acid. 7-ketolithocholic acid was converted into chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid. Since the specific activities of both bile acids were almost identical on day 1, the 7-keto bile acid probably was reduced equally into its respective 7a- and 7P-hydroxy derivatives. This interpretation seems valid because the proportion of ursodeoxycholic acid in the bile at this time was almost as large as chenodeoxycholic (37% vs. 49%) and suggests that the pool of ursodeoxycholic acid was about the same size as the pool of chenodeoxycholic acid. Although this experiment does not conclusively prove that 7-ketolithocholic acid is an obligatory precursor of ursodeoxycholic acid, our findings support such a possibility. There was increased amounts of ursodeoxycholic acid in the bile. This bile acid is the 7beta-hydroxy epimer of chenodeoxycholic acid and accounted for 3-37% of the circulating bile acid pool. Radioactive chenodeoxycholic acid was converted into ursodeoxycholic acid. Although the precise biochemical pathway has not been elucidated, there is evidence that 7-ketolithocholic acid is an intermediate. The reduction of the 7-keto group was presumably a hepatic process rather than carried out by bacteria in the intestine.",

  "The sequence of changes between lithocholic acid and alpha- and /Beta-muricholic acids is based on the observations by Thomas et al. (1964, 1965) on the metabolism of lithocholic acid and 3-alpha,6-beta-dihydroxy-5-alpha-cholanoic acid in intact rats. Evidence for the conversion of 3,B-hydroxychol-5-enoic acid into chenodeoxycholic acid via lithocholic acid has been given elsewhere (Mitropoulos & Myant, 1966b). The assumption that the radioactive 3,B-hydroxycholestenoic acid isolated from the incubation mixture is converted into C24 bile acids is supported by our finding that the addition of non-radioactive 3,B-hydroxycholestenoic acid diminishes the yield of radioactive C24 acids from [14C]cholesterol. If the pathway shown in Scheme 1 occurs in the intact rat, some of the lithocholic acid present in bile may be synthesized in the liver.",

The most common etiology, cystathionine-P-synthase deficiency, results in a decrease in the rate of conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine and is generally accompanied by hyper&ethionine&ia. Deficiencies in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine cause homocystinemia accompanied by hypomethioninemia but are much less common. In all these disorders, accumulated homocysteine is oxidized to homocystine, which is found in excessive amounts in blood and urine.",

Our current understanding is that two proteins, mitochondrial pyruvate carriers MPC1 and MPC2, form a hetero-oligomeric complex in the IMM to facilitate pyruvate transport. This step is required for mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation and carboxylation-critical reactions in intermediary metabolism that are dysregulated in several common diseases.",
  "Vanillylmandelic acid is instead formed in the liver by oxidation of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol catalyzed by alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases. Compared to intraneuronal deamination, extraneuronal O-methylation of norepinephrine and epinephrine to metanephrines represent minor pathways of metabolism. The single largest source of metanephrines is the adrenal medulla. Similarly, pheochromocytoma tumor cells produce large amounts of metanephrines from catecholamines leaking from stores. Thus, these metabolites are particularly useful for detecting pheochromocytomas.

  "Vanillylmandelic acid is instead formed in the liver by oxidation of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol catalyzed by alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases. Compared to intraneuronal deamination, extraneuronal O-methylation of norepinephrine and epinephrine to metanephrines represent minor pathways of metabolism.

  "The distribution of glyoxylate cycle enzymes between peroxisomal matrix and cytosol implies that within one cycle the peroxisomal membrane has to be crossed by various metabolites (Fig. 4). The mechanisms how such small organic metabolites are transported across the peroxisomal membrane are still a matter of debate. Early investigations indicated that yeast peroxisomes contain channels [70], [71] and [72] and allow free diffusion of metabolites. This is in accordance with experimental results from plants [73] or more recently from mammals [74] suggesting porin-like proteins in the peroxisomal membrane. An efficient transport by diffusion would require a steep gradient of solutes involved, in the case of the glyoxylate cycle citrate, malate and oxaloacetate and either glyoxylate (yeast) or isocitrate and succinate (plants). Moreover, as the intraperoxisomal pH was found to deviate from the cytosolic one in yeast [75] and [76] and in mammalian cells [77] and [78] a free diffusion is difficult to imagine. In addition, neither acetyl-CoA nor NAD+/NADH [8] nor ADP/ATP [79] were found to freely diffuse across the peroxisomal membrane. Thus, for these substances regulable transporter proteins seem to be required.",

  "Normal human urine contains small amounts (less than 4 mg/g of creatinine) of 2-ethylhydracrylic acid, formed, we believe, by a previously undisclosed endogenous catabolic pathway for the oxidation of a newly described series of R metabolites of isoleucine. 2. Urinary excretion of 2-ethylhydracrylic acid is variably increased in defects of isoleucine oxidation at distal steps in the catabolic pathway (3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase deficiency and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency) and is diminished when proximal steps of the oxidative pathway are blocked as in branched-chain oxo acid decarboxylase deficiency ('maple-syrup-urine' disease). 3. Precursors of R-pathway metabolites [R(-)-2-methylbutyrate and 2-ethylacrylate ] lead to increased 2-ethylhydracrylate excretion in the mammal(rat, rabbit and dog)",
  "N-arachidonyl-glycine is one of a series of N-arachidonyl-amino acids that are derived from arachidonic acid. N-arachidonyl-glycine is produced in a wide range of tissues with greatest abundance in the spinal cord. Here we report that N-arachidonyl-glycine is a reversible and non-competitive inhibitor of glycine transport by GLYT2a, but has little effect on glycine transport by GLYT1b or gamma-amino butyric acid transport by GAT1. It has previously been reported that the activity of GLYT2a is down-regulated by protein kinase C and therefore we investigated whether the actions of N-arachidonyl-glycine on GLYT2a are mediated by second messenger systems that lead to the activation of protein kinase C. However, the protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine, had no effect on the actions of N-arachidonyl-glycine on GLYT2a. Thus, the actions of N-arachidonyl-glycine are likely to be mediated by a direct interaction with the transporter. We have further defined the pharmacophore by investigating the actions of other N-arachidonyl amino acids as well as the closely related compounds arachidonic acid, anandamide and R1-methanandamide. Arachidonic acid, anandamide and R1-methanandamide have no effect on glycine transport, but N-arachidonyl-l-alanine has similar efficacy at GLYT2a to N-arachidonyl-glycine, and N-arachidonyl-gamma-amino butyric acid is less efficacious. These observations define a novel recognition site for the N-arachidonyl amino acids. This gene encodes a sodium- and chloride-dependent glycine neurotransmitter transporter. This integral membrane glycoprotein is responsible for the clearance of extracellular glycine during glycine-mediated neurotransmission. The stoichiometry of transport for GLYT2 is 3 Na+:1 Cl:1 glycine, suggesting that GLYT2 maintains nanomolar extracellular glycine levels. The stoichiometry of transport for GLYT1 is 2 Na+:1 Cl:1 glycine, suggesting that it sets a higher concentration of extracellular glycine.",

  "Succinylacetone (III, cf. Fig. 1) is not known to occur as an intermediate in any metabolic pathway.

If these compounds were reduced in vivo, succinylacetoacetate (VI) would be formed. The accumulation of metabolites of maleylacetoacetate or fumarylacetoacetate would imply a low activity for one or both enzymes involved in the metabolism of these compounds-i.e., maleylacetoacetate isomerase (4-maleylacetoacetate cistrans-isomerase, EC 5.2.1.2) and fumarylacetoacetase (4-fumarylacetoacetate fumarylhydrolase, EC 3.7.1.2).

Normal rats injected with this compound develop proteinuria, glucosuria, and aminoaciduira. Renal tubules incubated with succinylacetone have reduced amino acid, sugar, and phosphate transport, ATP levels and o2 consumption. succinylacetone inhibits renal brush-border membrane transport and alters membrane fluidity. thus, succinylacetone may be the cause of fanconi syndrome in tyrosinemia.",

  "The formation of the normal urinary metabolite 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoic acid (HMBA), excreted in abnormally high amounts in beta-ketothiolase deficiency, is not absolutely clarified. Metabolic pathways involving this metabolite are isoleucine catabolism, as well as presumably beta-oxidation of fatty acids and ketogenesis. The latter two pathways are distinguishable in their enantioselectivity. Enantioselective analysis gives further information on interfering metabolic pathways and the selectivity of the enzyme(s) forming HMBA. Different ratios of the stereoisomers of HMBA in control urine samples and patients with beta-ketothiolase deficiency were detected. Analogous to HMBA urinary 3-hydroxybutanoic acid (HBA) was investigated in several diseases. The formation of HBA and HMBA is expected to result from the same or similar metabolic pathways. Differences in the enantiomeric ratio of HMBA may originate from the enantioselectivity of different enzyme systems. pateints with beta-keto-thiolase deficiency (mitochondrial aceto-acetyl-CoA thiolase deficiency), an autosomal recessive inherited disease, lack the enzymr beta-keto-thiolase which cleave MOBA-CoA to acetyl-CoA and propanoyl-CoA resulting in significant disturbance in isoleucine metabolism. there is charateristic urine organic acid profile, i.e.,increased excretion of HMBA.",

Because the majority of patients with abnormal 3-methylglutaconic aciduria or acidemia appear to have normal leucine metabolism, we have speculated that some patients with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria may have defects of polyisoprenoid or sterol biosynthesis leading to overflow of isoprenoid precursors to 3-methylglutaconate via the mevalonate shunt. We therefore measured plasma levels of 3-methylglutaconic acid in patients with a known defect of sterol biosynthesis, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, and found that the patients with the lowest cholesterol levels had abnormally increased plasma levels of 3-methylglutaconic acid, similar in magnitude to those of patients with idiopathic 3-methylglutaconic aciduria.

  "Three new metabolites of medium-chain fatty acid oxidation, 3-, 6- and 7-hydroxyoctanoyl beta-D-glucuronide, were identified in the urine of six infants who were fed a diet enriched in medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). Glucuronides were extracted from the urine by organic solvent extraction with ethyl acetate and by solid-phase extraction on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges. The compounds of interest were also purified from the organic solvent extract by preparative one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. Cleavage of the glucuronides was achieved by either alkaline hydrolysis or enzymatic hydrolysis with beta-D-glucuronidase. The analyses of the trimethylsilylated derivatives were performed both by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC/FID) and by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The structure of the hydroxyoctanoic acids was proved by comparison of their mass spectra with those of reference substances. Authentic 6-hydroxyoctanoic acid was synthesized. The presence of 6-hydroxyoctanoyl glucuronide shows that in addition to beta-oxidation, omega-oxidation and (omega-1)-hydroxylation, medium-chain fatty acids can be oxidized at the omega-2 position. The conjugation of medium-chain hydroxy-monocarboxylic acids with glucuronic acid has not been described in humans before.",

  "We describe a gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric method for the accurate determination of n-hexanoylglycine, 3-phenylpropionylglycine and suberylglycine in urine for the diagnosis of hereditary medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency. These acylglycines had previously been detected in urine from patients with MCAD deficiency, but their diagnostic values were unknown because of a lack of appropriate analytical methods. n-Hexanoyl(1,2-13C)glycine, 3-phenylpropionyl(2-13C,15N)glycine and suberyl(2-13C,15N)glycine were synthesized and used as internal standards. Ammonia chemical ionization was utilized to generate intense [M + H]+ ions for selected-ion monitoring quantification. The whole procedure is fast and can be performed by a low-resolution gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric system, giving accurate results over a range of three orders of magnitude (0.0167-16.7 micrograms/ml). The results from the analyses of 54 urine samples from 21 MCAD-deficient patients and various control samples using this method established that n-hexanoyglycine and 3-phenylpropionylglycine were highly diagnostic for this disease, while suberylglycine was found less specific. Suberylglycine (HOOC(CH2)6CONHCH2COOH) was found in the urine from a patient with C6-C10-omega-dicarboxylic aciduria and unexplained episodes of lethargy and unconsciousness.",

In addition to the previously reported abnormalities, urine extracts from three cases of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency have shown consistently increased amounts of 2,4-dihydroxybutyric acid, and its lactone, and 3-hydroxypropionic acid, metabolites related to the alpha-oxidation of 4-hydroxybutyric acid. Threo- and erythro-4,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acids have also been identified for the first time and probably arise from the reaction of succinic semialdehyde with an intermediate in the pyruvate dehydrogenase pathway. Adipic acid excretion is also consistently raised, suggesting secondary interference with mitochondrial beta-oxidation. The presence of these metabolites could be a source of diagnostic confusion",

However, from our point of view, the agmatinetransport  mechanism  in  rat  brain  may  well  correspond  toeither OCT2 or EMT. Thus, protonation of the amino group of agmatine dependsvery  much  on  pH.  For  example,  the  fraction  of  agmatinemolecules with a single positive charge will be 2.6% at pH 7.5and 21% at pH 8.5. If agmatine2was the substrate, thenuptake velocity should decline with increasing pH. However,the opposite was observed. Agmatine uptake increased dra-matically with increasing pH (Fig. 7a) and was directly pro-portional to agmatineconcentration (Fig. 7b). Thus, agma-tine with a single positive charge is the sole substrate. Ag-matine2, after all, could be an inhibitor of transport. How-ever, since our data for the determination ofKmandKi(Fig.5) do not show any deviation from simple models, we supposethat agmatine2has no significant affinity for the non-neu-ronal  monoamine  transporters.",

  "evidenced in intestinal cells. The mechanism of absorption of sphingosine was studied in human intestinal epithelial cells Caco-2 and HT-29-D4. The experiments were performed below the critical micellar concentration of sphingosine which was evaluated to 6 microM by surface tension measurements. [3H]Sphingosine uptake was not inhibited by Na+-free conditions, ATP depletion, L-cycloserine or methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, consistent with a passive diffusion mechanism independent of lipid raft integrity. Molecular modeling studies suggested that sphingosine can adopt two distinct conformations: a high-energy \"snake-like\" conformer in water and an extended low-energy conformer in lipid phases. We propose that the energy stored in the compressed snake-like conformer is transformed into kinetic energy, allowing: (i) the motion of sphingosine through the unstirred water layer bathing the mucosal enterocyte surface, and (ii) its insertion into the enterocyte brush border membrane. Dietary lipids that stabilized the extended sphingosine conformer in mixed micelles (e.g., cholesterol and sphingomyelin) induced a marked inhibition of sphingosine absorption.",

Renal excretion is the primary elimination pathway for the metabolite. In individuals with normal renal function, approximately 10% of the dose is excreted as M1 ; about 44% as M5, respectively. A parallel pathway to the formation of M1 is hydroxylation of the phenyl ring, forming metabolite M3, which is then also excreted renally. 3H less & one charge more in product side. One proton added to product side for element & charge balance.",
  "antiport transport for uptake of torasemide has been assumed, since, OATP1B1 mediates hepatic uptake of torasemide in an antipor manner, in exchange of bicarbonate.",
  "In healthy volunteers ; patients with normal renal function, approximately 20% of a dose of torasemide is eliminated unchanged in the urine. The high renal clearance of torasemide indicates that the major part of torasemide is secreted by the proximal tubular anion carrier system. Hence, organic anion antiport mechanism has been assumed for hepatocytes. OAT4 located in the kidney, exchanges organic anions (efflux) for chloride (uptake). In another study, authors found that large variation in the renal clearance of torsemide, which was partially explained by genetic variation in the luminally expressed OAT4 rather than by polymorphisms in the genes coding for basolaterally located OAT1 ; OAT3.",
  "OAT1 plays a major role in the renal secretion of preferentially hydrophilic organic anions such as endogenous metabolites, xenobiotics, ; drugs. Located on the basolateral side of the proximal tubule cells, it mediates the uptake of these compounds into the cells against a negative membrane potential ; in exchange for the Krebs cycle intermediate a-ketoglutarate. Consequently, it is held responsible for the nephrotoxicity of some substances like the endogenous uremic toxins, antiviral drugs, ; cephaloridines , as well as the mycotoxin ochratoxin A. Besides kidneys, OAT1 was also detected in other organs such as liver, skeletal muscle, brain, ; eye, where it may be involved in the secretion of neurotransmitter metabolites. Further, it was shown that torsemide interacts with the human OATs 1, 3 ; 4 located at the renal tubules. OAT1 is also expressed in liver, ; possibly aid in efflux of torasemide.",
  "No specific intestinal transporter for Torasemide has been identified.",
  "CYP3A4 is involved in formation of hydroxy metabolites. Pravastatin yielded 12 different metabolites in urine, when administered orally. H2o2 added to product side for element balancing.",
  "in contrast to the transporters for exit into hepatic vein not being identified, biliary transporters has been characterized. MRP2, BCRP & BSEP are involved in pravastatin & its metabolites transport into bile.",
  "12 different pravastatin metabolites has been detected in urine in case of humans, after oral administration of pravastatin. However, for this statin, both urine ; biliary excretion exists. Additionally, pravastatin undergoes extensive enterohepatic circulation, when exit is through biliary route.",
  "The urinary metabolites after a therapeutic dose of paracetamol were identified as free paracetamol, paracetamol sulphate, 3-hydroxy-paracetamol-3-sulphate, 3-methoxy-paracetamol sulphate, paracetamol glucuronide, 3-methoxy-paracetamol glucuronide, paracetamol 3-cysteine conjugate ; paracetamol 3-mercapturate.",
  "minor oxidative metabolites of acetaminophen, i.e., thiomethyl & thiomethyl-sulphoxide are glucuronidated ; sulphated for release into hepatic vein, ; finally in urine. One proton added to prodcut side for element & charge balance.",
