def test_compass_smoke_test(num_processes):

    Just checks that Compass runs end-to-end without crashing in a very
    minimalistic setting.
    Takes 54s on my laptop.
    We use 1 process to turn multi-processing off, which can otherwise
    hide errors. We also try with 2 processes to excercise multiprocessing.
    You can also manually run this from the command line as follows:
    $ compass --media media1 --data compass/Resources/Test\ Data/rsem_tpmTable_2cells.txt \
        --output-dir _test_compass_smoke_test --num-processes 1 --test-mode

def test_compass_smoke_test_2():
    r"""
    Same test as above, but now runs on ALL reactions (does not use --test-mode)
    To avoid this test being slow due to CPLEX, CPLEX is stubbed.
    Takes 30s on my laptop.
    We use 1 process to turn multi-processing off, which can otherwise
    hide errors. Also, we _must_ turn multiprocessing off or else the
    subprocesses won't have CPLEX stubbed and so the test would take forever.
    You can also manually run this from the command line as follows, but do note
    that CPLEX _WON'T BE STUBBED_ so it will take a while:
    $ compass --media media1 --data compass/Resources/Test\ Data/rsem_tpmTable_2cells.txt \
